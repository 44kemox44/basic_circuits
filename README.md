# Fundamental Circuits for LTSpice

This repository contains a structured collection of **fundamental circuits** implemented in LTSpice.  
It is organized by topic, from the very basics (e.g., resistive dividers) to more advanced building blocks (e.g., current mirrors, amplifiers, filters).  

The goal is to create a **reference library** for students and engineers working with analog electronics.
